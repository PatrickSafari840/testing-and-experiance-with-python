This repository contains two fun and engaging Python scripts:

1. Mystery Number Challenge
----------------------------
This script implements a classic guessing game where you try to identify a secret number chosen by the computer.

How to Play:

Run the Script: Save the file Mystery_Number_Challenge.py and execute it using python Mystery_Number_Challenge.py in your terminal.
Guess the Number: The computer will generate a random number between a specified range (default: 1 to 100). You'll have a certain number of attempts (default: 7) to guess the number correctly.
Feedback: After each guess, the program will provide hints like "Too High" or "Too Low" to guide you.
Win or Lose: If you guess the number within the allowed attempts, you win! Otherwise, the game reveals the secret number.
Challenge Yourself:

Try modifying the code to adjust the difficulty level (change the number range or attempts).
Consider adding additional features like keeping track of your best score or displaying the number of remaining attempts.

Run the Script: Save the file snake_game.py and execute it using python snake_game.py in your terminal.
Controls: Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the movement of the snake.
